- Drop the SZ-hosp_nowcast model from all stratified performance evaluation due to it masking other meaningful between model differences. 

# 2022-01-05

- Fixed a bug which meant that the 10% quantile was not included in posterior predictions. In order to avoid refitting all models this quantile has been excluded from evaluation and the `targets` pipeline has been updated so that models are never refit.

# 2021-12-06

- Added a new model that is the same as the baseline independent model but that also includes a day of the week adjustment for the date of positive test. From today this model is used as the hub submission model instead of the original independent model.Â This change is based on backtesting to the 1st of October which showed an approximate 10% increase in both absolute and relative performance for the 0 to -7 horizons across all groups excluding the 5-14 year olds where performance was slightly degraded. This change will be monitored over the next few weeks to make sure the performance improvement is stable. The only downside is a roughly 100% increase in model estimation times but this is still well within the available compute.
- This change impacts both national age stratified nowcasts and state level nowcasts.
- Updated documentation to reflect the change to the submission model.
- Updated the `targets` tracking to never rebuild nowcast submissions if already present to prevent overwriting past nowcast submissions when models are changed.

# 2021-12-3

- Fix plotting in reports so that more than 7 models/methods can be shown.
- Adds caching to documentation rendering to prevent all forecasts being downloaded each time documentation is built.

# 2021-12-01

- Added tools to access nowcasts submitted to the Germany nowcasting hub
- Added tools to allow the evaluation approach used in this project to be applied to the nowcasts from the Germany nowcasting hub.
- Added an overall score summary plot

# 2021-11-24

- Added README's for the data and bash script folders. 
- Added retrospective nowcasts back to the 15th of October 2021.

# 2021-11-23

- Added an introduction and methods write up. 
- Added a real-time evaluation report skeleton.
- Added additional repository and project details to the README.
- Added a home page to the published reports webpage linking to resources.

# 2021-11-20

- Added a initial framework for reporting the nowcast results.
- Added a simple adjustment for spuriously large or small quantiles when models have had issues with fitting. This is simply a rescaling of quantiles that are greater/smaller than 25% of the median.

# 2021-11-19

- Simplified the model with an age grouped random walk to have independent random walks by age rather than a shared global walk and a group specific random walk in the residuals. This was based on initial backcasting where the more complex model was unstable during fitting indicating issues with the model formulation.

# 2021-11-17

- Add targets workflow for processing new data.
- Add targets workflow for nowcasting using a range of models.
- Add targets workflow for formatting nowcasts and added nowcast metadata.

# 2021-10-26

- Initial version of semi-parametric nowcasting model with flexible date of reference and date of report effects implemented in stan with supporting R parsing code.

# 2021-10-17

- Set up project and imported key files from `{EpiNow2}`.
